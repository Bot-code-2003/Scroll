        <p>
          I always wondered how websites always look cool and are interactive.
          That caught my attention and made me motivated to learn Web
          Development.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">How I started?</h2>
        <p>
          Well i first get to know that those effects are called scroll efects
          that actually work with the help of java scrip language. So I started
          to learn java script which didnt even took me a week to just make
          small websites with a very subtle functionalites.
